-- an edge of over 5.5% advantage for males.

-- Question 5: Should the institute alter its selection criteria 
-- for work experience to increase the average placement salary? 
-- (Do not remove outliers while answering.)

-- ANS: Given that the current selection criteria wasn't given, the

-- This is because even though there's about 23% increase in salary of those 
-- with work-exp, there's only a 1% diff in favour of exp candidates regarding
-- their marks scored in the employability test. This shows in_exp candidates
-- are considerably as good as those with exp.
